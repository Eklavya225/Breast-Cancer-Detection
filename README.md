# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant, helping in early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVM), the model achieves a classification accuracy of 92%. Feature selection techniques were applied to enhance predictive performance by 15%
